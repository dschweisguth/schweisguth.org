Create EC2 instance:
region = us-west-2
AMI = Current "Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type"
instance type = t2.micro
storage =  8 GB storage
security group = "http, https, ssh"
Assign an Elastic IP address (currently 52.40.204.214)

Configure HTTP:

On the instance,
# yum update -y
# reboot
# yum install -y emacs httpd mod_ssl
# chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /var/www/html

On hladik,
$ bin/push-to-ec2-instance
Note that only a minimal change to httpd.conf is needed, to permit things in .htaccess:
# diff httpd.conf{.old,}
151c151
<     AllowOverride None
---
>     AllowOverride AuthConfig Options

On the instance,
# systemctl enable httpd
# systemctl start httpd

Configure HTTPS:
Per https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SSL-on-amazon-linux-2.html#letsencrypt:
# wget -r --no-parent -A 'epel-release-*.rpm' https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/
# rpm -Uvh dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-*.rpm
# yum-config-manager --enable epel*
# rm -r dl.fedoraproject.org
# yum install -y certbot python2-certbot-apache
The following relies on httpd having been started and the server names to be certified being in httpd configuration.
# certbot
Certify schweisguth.org and www.schweisguth.org (the latter just for redirection)
In httpd-le-ssl.conf (just generated by certbot), add the following to redirect from www to the apex:
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =www.schweisguth.org
    RewriteRule ^ https://schweisguth.org%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
# crontab ~/lib/crontab
# systemctl restart httpd
Copy httpd.conf and httpd-le-ssl.conf to files/root/etc/httpd/conf
Refactor: Merge conf/httpd-le-ssl.conf into conf.d/schweisguth.org.conf. Remove the last line of httpd.conf (added by certbot). Redeploy and restart.

Harden SSL configuration:
Again, per AWS documentation linked to above:
Test SSL at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
Determine versions of httpd and openssl:
$ yum list installed | grep httpd
$ yum list installed | grep openssl
Generate SSLProtocol and SSLCipherSuite at https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/
Add the results to ssl.conf
# systemctl restart httpd
Test SSL at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ again
The changes in this section did not improve the score, I suppose because current httpd no longer includes obsolete protocols or ciphers.
Copy ssl.conf to files/root/etc/httpd/conf.d

CDR has an A record for the apex with the Elastic IP address and a CNAME for www pointing to the apex.
